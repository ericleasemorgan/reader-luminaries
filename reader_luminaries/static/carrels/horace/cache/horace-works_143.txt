        EPISTLES I. EPISTLE IV. TO ALBIUS TIBULLUS
        He declares his accomplishments; and, after proposing the thought of death, converts it into an occasion of pleasantry.
        Albius, thou candid critic of my discourses, what shall I say you are now doing in the country about Pedum? Writing what may excel the works of Cassius Parmensis; or sauntering silently among the healthful groves, concerning yourself about every thing worthy a wise and good man? You were not a body without a mind. The gods have given you a beautiful form, the gods[ have given] you wealth, and the faculty of enjoying it.
        What greater blessing could a nurse solicit for her beloved child, than that he might be wise, and able to express his sentiments; and that respect, reputation, health might happen to him in abundance, and decent living, with a never- failing purse?
        In the midst of hope and care, in the midst of fears and disquietudes, think every day that shines upon you is the last. [Thus] the hour, which shall not be expected, will come upon you an agreeable addition.
        When you have a mind to laugh, you shall see me fat and sleek with good keeping, a hog of Epicurus ' herd.
