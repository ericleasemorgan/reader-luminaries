OF TRUTH What is truth? said jesting Pilate, and would not stay for an answer.
But it is not only the difficulty and labor, which men take in finding out of truth, nor again, that when it is found, it imposeth upon men's thoughts, that doth bring lies in favor; but a natural though corrupt love, of the lie itself.
Truth may perhaps come to the price of a pearl, that showeth best by day; but it will not rise to the price of a diamond, or carbuncle, that showeth best in varied lights.
A mixture of a lie doth ever add pleasure.
But it is not the lie that passeth through the mind, but the lie that sinketh in, and settleth in it, that doth the hurt; such as we spake of before.
But, howsoever these things are thus in men's depraved judgments, and affections, yet truth, which only doth judge itself, teacheth that the inquiry of truth, which is the love-making, or wooing of it, the knowledge of truth, which is the presence of it, and the belief of truth, which is the enjoying of it, is the sovereign good of human nature.
To pass from theological, and philosophical truth, to the truth of civil business; it will be acknowledged, even by those that practise it not, that clear, and round dealing, is the honor of man's nature; and that mixture of falsehoods, is like alloy in coin of gold and silver, which may make the metal work the better, but it embaseth it.
Saith he, If it be well weighed, to say that a man lieth, is as much to say, as that he is brave towards God, and a coward towards men.
For a lie faces God, and shrinks from man.
For truth and falsehood, in such things, are like the iron and clay, in the toes of Nebuchadnezzar's image; they may cleave, but they will not incorporate.
The virtue of prosperity, is temperance; the virtue of adversity, is fortitude; which in morals is the more heroical virtue.
Certainly virtue is like precious odors, most fragrant when they are incensed, or crushed: for prosperity doth best discover vice, but adversity doth best discover virtue.
Grave natures, led by custom, and therefore constant, are commonly loving husbands, as was said of Ulysses, vetulam suam praetulit immortalitati.
Chaste women are often proud and froward, as presuming upon the merit of their chastity.
A man that hath no virtue in himself, ever envieth virtue in others.
For he that cannot possibly mend his own case, will do what he can, to impair another's; except these defects light upon a very brave, and heroical nature, which thinketh to make his natural wants part of his honor; in that it should be said, that an eunuch, or a lame man, did such great matters; affecting the honor of a miracle; as it was in Narses the eunuch, and Agesilaus and Tamberlanes, that were lame men.
Those that have joined with their honor great travels, cares, or perils, are less subject to envy.
For men think that they earn their honors hardly, and pity them sometimes; and pity ever healeth envy.
OF LOVE
For there was never proud man thought so absurdly well of himself, as the lover doth of the person loved; and therefore it was well said, That it is impossible to love, and to be wise.
For it is a true rule, that love is ever rewarded, either with the reciproque, or with an inward and secret contempt.
For whosoever esteemeth too much of amorous affection, quitteth both riches and wisdom.
They do best, who if they cannot but admit love, yet make it keep quarters; and sever it wholly from their serious affairs, and actions, of life; for if it check once with business, it troubleth men's fortunes, and maketh men, that they can no ways be true to their own ends.
For integrity used doth the one; but integrity professed, and with a manifest detestation of bribery, doth the other.
It is an assured sign of a worthy and generous spirit, whom honor amends.
For honor is, or should be, the place of virtue and as in nature, things move violently to their place, and calmly in their place, so virtue in ambition is violent, in authority settled and calm.
Goodness answers to the theological virtue, charity, and admits no excess, but error.
Errors indeed in this virtue of goodness, or charity, may be committed.
For divinity, maketh the love of ourselves the pattern; the love of our neighbors, but the portraiture.
But it is reason, the memory of their virtues remain to their posterity, and their faults die with themselves.
On the other side, nobility extinguisheth the passive envy from others, towards them; because they are in possession of honor.
Divide with reason; between selflove and society; and be so true to thyself, as thou be not false to others; specially to thy king and country.
So that it is in truth, of operation upon a man's mind, of like virtue as the alchemists use to attribute to their stone, for man's body; that it worketh all contrary effects, but still to the good and benefit of nature.
OF EXPENSE Riches are for spending, and spending for honor and good actions.
OF THE TRUE GREATNESS OF KINGDOMS AND ESTATES
Honor hath three things in it: the vantage ground to do good; the approach to kings and principal persons; and the raising of a man's own fortunes.
He that hath the best of these intentions, when he aspireth, is an honest man; and that prince, that can discern of these intentions in another that aspireth, is a wise prince.
Certainly the great multiplication of virtues upon human nature, resteth uponsocieties well ordained and disciplined.
OF FORTUNE It cannot be denied, but outward accidents conduce much to fortune; favor, opportunity, death of others, occasion fitting virtue.
Overt and apparent virtues, bring forth praise; but there be secret and hidden virtues, that bring forth fortune; certain deliveries of a man's self, which have no name.
And certainly there be not two more fortunate properties, than to have a little of the fool, and not too much of the honest.
Fortune is to be honored and respected, and it be but for her daughters, Confidence and Reputation.
OF BEAUTY Virtue is like a rich stone, best plain set; and surely virtue is best, in a body that is comely, though not of delicate features; and that hath rather dignity of presence, than beauty of aspect.
Neither is it almost seen, that very beautiful persons are otherwise of great virtue; as if nature were rather busy, not to err, than in labor to produce excellency.
In beauty, that of favor, is more than that of color; and that of decent and gracious motion, more than that of favor.
That is the best part of beauty, which a picture cannot express; no, nor the first sight of the life.
There is no excellent beauty, that hath not some strangeness in the proportion.
And indeed it is the purest of human pleasures.
OF CEREMONIES AND RESPECT He that is only real, had need have exceeding great parts of virtue; as the stone had need to be rich, that is set without foil.
OF PRAISE Praise is the reflection of virtue; but it is as the glass or body, which giveth the reflection.
Some men are praised maliciously, to their hurt, thereby to stir envy and jealousy towards them: pessimum genus inimicorum laudantium; insomuch as it was a proverb, amongst the Grecians, that he that was praised to his hurt, should have a push rise upon his nose; as we say, that a blister will rise upon one's tongue, that tells a lie.
They that are glorious, must needs be factious; for an bravery stands upon comparisons.
In militar commanders and soldiers, vain-glory is an essential point; for as iron sharpens iron, so by glory, one courage sharpeneth another.
Certainly vain-glory helpeth to perpetuate a man's memory; and virtue was never so beholding to human nature, as it received his due at the second hand.
OF HONOR AND REPUTATION
The winning of honor, is but the revealing of a man's virtue and worth, without disadvantage.
If a man perform that, which hath not been attempted before; or attempted and given over; or hath been achieved, but not with so good circumstance; he shall purchase more honor, than by effecting a matter of greater difficulty or virtue, wherein he is but a follower.
A man is an ill husband of his honor, that entereth into any action, the failing wherein may disgrace him, more than the carrying of it through, can honor him.
Honor that is gained and broken upon another, hath the quickest reflection, like diamonds cut with facets.
Envy, which is the canker of honor, is best extinguished by declaring a man's self in his ends, rather to seek merit than fame; and by attributing a man's successes, rather to divine Providence and felicity, than to his own virtue or policy.
The true marshalling of the degrees of sovereign honor, are these: In the first place are conditores imperiorum, founders of states and commonwealths; such as were Romulus, Cyrus, Caesar, Ottoman, Ismael.
Degrees of honor, in subjects, are, first participes curarum, those upon whom, princes do discharge the greatest weight of their affairs; their right hands, as we call them.
There is an honor, likewise, which may be ranked amongst the greatest, which happeneth rarely; that is, of such as sacrifice themselves to death or danger for the good of their country; as was M. Regulus, and the two Decii.
Above all things, integrity is their portion and proper virtue.
