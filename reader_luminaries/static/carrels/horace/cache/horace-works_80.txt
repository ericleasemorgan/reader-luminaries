        ODES III. ODE XXII. TO DIANA
        O virgin, protectress of the mountains and the groves, thou three- formed goddess, who thrice invoked, hearest young women in labor, and savest them from death; sacred to thee be this pine that overshadows my villa, which I, at the completion of every year, joyful will present with the blood of a boar- pig, just meditating his oblique attack.
