OF TRUTH What is truth? said jesting Pilate, and would not stay for an answer.
But, howsoever these things are thus in men's depraved judgments, and affections, yet truth, which only doth judge itself, teacheth that the inquiry of truth, which is the love-making, or wooing of it, the knowledge of truth, which is the presence of it, and the belief of truth, which is the enjoying of it, is the sovereign good of human nature.
To pass from theological, and philosophical truth, to the truth of civil business; it will be acknowledged, even by those that practise it not, that clear, and round dealing, is the honor of man's nature; and that mixture of falsehoods, is like alloy in coin of gold and silver, which may make the metal work the better, but it embaseth it.
Those that have joined with their honor great travels, cares, or perils, are less subject to envy.
For honor is, or should be, the place of virtue and as in nature, things move violently to their place, and calmly in their place, so virtue in ambition is violent, in authority settled and calm.
Divide with reason; between selflove and society; and be so true to thyself, as thou be not false to others; specially to thy king and country.
Honor hath three things in it: the vantage ground to do good; the approach to kings and principal persons; and the raising of a man's own fortunes.
OF BEAUTY Virtue is like a rich stone, best plain set; and surely virtue is best, in a body that is comely, though not of delicate features; and that hath rather dignity of presence, than beauty of aspect.
OF PRAISE Praise is the reflection of virtue; but it is as the glass or body, which giveth the reflection.
Certainly vain-glory helpeth to perpetuate a man's memory; and virtue was never so beholding to human nature, as it received his due at the second hand.
OF HONOR AND REPUTATION
The winning of honor, is but the revealing of a man's virtue and worth, without disadvantage.
Honor that is gained and broken upon another, hath the quickest reflection, like diamonds cut with facets.
Envy, which is the canker of honor, is best extinguished by declaring a man's self in his ends, rather to seek merit than fame; and by attributing a man's successes, rather to divine Providence and felicity, than to his own virtue or policy.
Above all things, integrity is their portion and proper virtue.
In causes of life and death, judges ought (as far as the law permitteth) in justice to remember mercy; and to cast a severe eye upon the example, but a merciful eye upon the person.
