        ODES III. ODE XIII. TO THE BANDUSIAN FOUNTAIN
        O thou fountain of Bandusia, clearer than glass, worthy of delicious wine, not unadorned by flowers; to- morrow thou shalt be presented with a kid, whose forehead, pouting with new horns, determines upon both love and war in vain; for this offspring of the wanton flock shall tinge thy cooling streams with scarlet blood. The severe season of the burning dog- star can not reach thee; thou affordest a refreshing coolness to the oxen fatigued with the plough- share, and to the ranging flock. Thou also shalt become one of the famous fountains, through my celebrating the oak that covers the hollow rock, whence thy prattling rills descend with a bound.
