        EPODES. ODE IV. TO MENAS
        As great an enmity as is allotted by nature to wolves and lambs,[ so great a one] have I to you, you that are galled at your back with Spanish cords, and on your legs with the hard fetter. Though, purse- proud with your riches, you strut along, yet fortune does not alter your birth. Do you not observe while you are stalking along the sacred way with a robe twice three ells long, how the most open indignation of those that pass and repass turns their looks on thee? This fellow,[ say they,] cut with the triumvir 's whips, even till the beadle was sick of his office, plows a thousand acres of Falernian land, and wears out the Appian road with his nags; and, in despite of Otho, sits in the first rows[ of the circus] as a knight of distinction. To what purpose is it, that so many brazen- beaked ships of immense bulk should be led out against pirates and a band of slaves, while this fellow, this is a military tribune?
