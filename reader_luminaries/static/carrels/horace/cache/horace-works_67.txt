        ODES III. ODE IX. TO LYDIA
        HORACE. As long as I was agreeable to thee, and no other youth more favored was wo nt to fold his arms around thy snowy neck, I lived happier than the Persian monarch.
        LYDIA. As long as thou hadst not a greater flame for any other, nor was Lydia below Chloe[ in thine affections], I Lydia, of distinguished fame, flourished more eminent than the Roman Ilia.
        HOR. The Thracian Chloe now commands me, skillful in sweet modulations, and a mistress of the lyre; for whom I would not dread to die, if the fates would spare her, my surviving soul.
        LYD. Calais, the son of the Thurian Ornitus, inflames me with a mutual fire; for whom I would twice endure to die, if the fates would spare my surviving youth.
        HOR. What! if our former love returns, and unites by a brazen yoke us once parted? What if Chloe with her golden locks be shaken off, and the door again open to slighted Lydia.
        LYD. Though he is fairer than a star, thou of more levity than a cork, and more passionate than the blustering Adriatic; with thee I should love to live, with thee I would cheerfully die.
