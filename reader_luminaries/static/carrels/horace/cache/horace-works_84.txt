        ODES III. ODE XXVI. TO VENUS
        I lately lived a proper person for girls, and campaigned it not without honor; but now this wall, which guards the left side of[ the statue] of sea- born Venus, shall have my arms and my lyre discharged from warfare. Here, here, deposit the shining flambeaux, and the wrenching irons, and the bows, that threatened the resisting doors. O thou goddess, who possessest the blissful Cyprus, and Memphis free from Sithonian snow, O queen, give the haughty Chloe one cut with your high- raised lash.
